# GitHub Pages Setup

This directory contains the GitHub Pages site for the HECTUR project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select the branch (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Select the folder: `/docs`
   - Click Save

2. **Your site will be available at:**
   - `https://[your-username].github.io/eecs106a-final-project/`
   - Or if using a custom domain, your configured domain

3. **To update the site:**
   - Simply push changes to the `docs/` folder
   - GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild (may take a few minutes)

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main project report page

## Notes

- The site uses plain HTML/CSS (no Jekyll required)
- All styling is embedded in the HTML file
- Make sure to update the GitHub repository link in the "Additional Materials" section
